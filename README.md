# What I learned: 
- Be able to apply fundamental DC and AC analysis techniques to solve simple passive electrical networks.
- Be able to analyse simple electronic circuits with respect to AC and DC behaviour.
- Understand principles of operation of operational amplifiers, and be able to solve and design simple circuits with operational amplifiers.
- Understand the use of electrical circuits in electrical power, control and telecommunications applications.
- Be able to construct and measure DC and AC properties of simple circuits using breadboard, oscilloscopes and multimeters. 
- Have a conceptual understanding of key topics in power systems, telecomunications, and control systems engineering; and how they relate to other engineering disciplines and socety more broadly.
